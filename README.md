# VISA Web Application

This project contains the source code for the Web Application of the VISA platform.

VISA (Virtual Infrastructure for Scientific Analysis) makes it simple to create compute instances on facility cloud infrastructure to analyse your experimental data using just your web browser.

See the [User Manual](https://visa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for deployment instructions and end user documentation.

## Description

Using the VISA Web Application, users can

- Create compute instances for data analysis or remote experiments
- Connect to the remote desktops of the instances
- Share access to their desktops with other users (collaborating scientists or technical support)
- Access JupyterLab running on their instances
